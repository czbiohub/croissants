# Cupcakes & Coding
Cupcakes &amp; Coding is a safe place to talk about your programming struggles

## What is "Cupcakes & Coding?"

Cupcakes & Coding is a beginner-friendly, safe place to learn programming, from. We meet every week on **Thursdays from 9:30-11am** and alternate between **Office Hours** on the _1st and 3rd Thursdays_ of the month and **Tutorials** on the _2nd and 4th Thursdays_ of the month, in the Inner Sunset conference room. Any level of coding experience is welcome!

Both sessions are hands-on, interactive coding sessions where we all learn together!

### What happens during Tutorials?

In **Tutorials**, someone shares knowledge by leading a tutorial showcasing a useful computational skill, focused around solving a biological problem. Most presenters have 6 months -- 2 years coding experience, and 30% started with no knowledge of programming at all before Cupcakes & Coding. Past presentations included:

*   Basic introduction to de novo sequence assembly of genomes or transcripts from NGS data
*   Automating FACS plots using R and ggplot2
*   A beginners guide to protein visualization using PyMOL, a versatile and open-source molecular graphics environment
*   Making publication-quality figures in Adobe Illustrator

### What happens during Office Hours?

In **Office Hours**, fellow Biohub members are available to answer any and all computer questions, even if you think they are “dumb.” Questions can range from:

*   How do I get started with programming?
*   What's the best aligner?
*   How do I reformat this 384 well excel spreadsheet into 4 96 well ones?
*   How do I run 1000s of jobs in the cloud?
*   What is AWS and how can I best use it?


## Who can attend?

All are welcome, regardless of programming experience, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.

## Will there be cupcakes?

Yes, there will be cupcakes from [La Luna Cupcakes](https://www.lalunacupcakes.com), including a vegan option.

## Who can I ask for questions?

Email olga.botvinnik@czbiohub.org if you have any questions, comments, or concerns. Also check out the #cupcakes-and-coding Slack channel for updates, and ask in the #eng-support Slack channel for day-to-day questions and discussions about computational woes.
