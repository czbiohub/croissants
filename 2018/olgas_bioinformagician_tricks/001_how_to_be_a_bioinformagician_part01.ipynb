    "# How to be a Bioinformagician part 1\n",
    "- Author: Olga Botvinnik\n",
    "- Date: 2018-10-09\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract: Many computational problems have already been solved and yet hundreds of hours are lost to re-solving them. This series provides tips and tricks that solve common pain points in bioinformatics, using AWS, reading/writing CSVs, extracting data out of file names, and lots more!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisities\n",
    "1. Everything you do should be full screen. Use [divvy](http://mizage.com/divvy/) to make managing windows easier - ask IT for a license\n",
    "1. [anaconda python](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) - Install the 3.x (e.g. 3.7) version if you don't have it already\n",
    "1. aws account - Ask Olga or James for one\n",
    "1. awscli and aegea - on the command line, `pip install awscli aegea` after you install Anaconda Python\n",
    "1. nbconda - on the command line, `conda install nb_conda` after you install Anaconda Python\n",
    "1. reflow. Click this link: https://github.com/grailbio/reflow/releases/download/reflow0.6.8/reflow0.6.8.darwin.amd64 Then on the command line:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    cd ~/Downloads\n",
    "    chmod ugo+x reflow0.6.8.darwin.amd64\n",
    "    sudo mv reflow0.6.8.darwin.amd64 /usr/local/bin/reflow\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Now the command `reflow` should output a lot of stuff:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "      reflow\n",
    "    The reflow command helps users run Reflow programs, inspect their\n",
    "    outputs, and query their statuses.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The command comprises a set of subcommands; the list of supported\n",
    "    commands can be obtained by running\n",
    "\n",
    "        reflow -help\n",
    "\n",
    "    ... (more stuff) ...\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Then configure reflow, following the [Confluence entry on Reflow (https://czbiohub.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DS/pages/838205454/reflow) instructions for configuration:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=1 reflow setup-ec2\n",
    "    AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=1 reflow setup-s3-repository czbiohub-reflow-quickstart-cache\n",
    "    AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=1 reflow setup-dynamodb-assoc czbiohub-reflow-quickstart\n",
    "    export AWS_REGION=us-west-2\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "1. Claim a folder within `s3://czbiohub-cupcakes/` with today's date and your username, e.g.:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    s3://czbiohub-cupcakes/2018-10-09/olgabot/\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "1. [GitHub](http://github.com) username and membership to [@czbiohub](https://github.com/czbiohub/) GitHub group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Highly recommended:\n",
    "- If you haven't seen it already, follow https://github.com/czbiohub/codonboarding\n",
    "- Especially \n",
    "    - install homebrew - it makes your life better for installing packages on mac\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    /usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - install Oh My ZSH: https://ohmyz.sh/\n",
    "    - Install exa: https://the.exa.website/ - MUCH easier to install if you installed homebrew.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    brew install exa\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Clone the cupcakes repo to `~/code` if you haven't already\n",
    "\n",

    "## Running the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`cd` to your `~/code` directory in the terminal, then type `jupyter notebook`:\n",
